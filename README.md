# SQLAlchemy JS Auth: A Comprehensive Authorization Framework

## Introduction

SQLAlchemy JS is a powerful, extensible authentication and authorization framework built on top of SQLAlchemy, designed to provide robust access control mechanisms for web applications. The project emphasizes flexibility, scalability, and integration with existing SQL-based systems. It enables developers to define complex permission hierarchies that can be tied to specific database objects or global contexts.

This document explores the core features, architecture, and practical applications of SQLAlchemy JS, demonstrating how it can be leveraged in real-world scenarios to secure complex data-driven systems.

## Core Architecture

### 1. **Permission Model Hierarchy**

SQLAlchemy JS introduces a sophisticated permission model that supports three primary types:

- **Path Permissions**: These permissions are tied to specific database object paths, allowing fine-grained control over individual resources or collections.
- **Global Permissions**: Applied across the entire system or specific contexts, providing broad access controls.
- **Composite Permissions**: Through logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`), complex permission rules can be constructed from simpler components.

### 2. **Core Components**

The framework is composed of several key modules:

#### Authentication Engine (`Auth` Class)
```python
class Auth:
    def __init__(
        self,
        base_class: DeclarativeBase,
        propagation_schema: Dict[str, List[str]] = None,
        actions: Dict[str, Any] = None,
        user_model: Type[UserMixin] = None,
        group_model: Type[UserGroupMixin] = None,
        role_model: Type[RoleMixin] = None,
        permission_model: Type[PermissionMixin] = None,
    ):
        ...
```

The `Auth` class serves as the central hub for managing all authentication and authorization logic. It maintains:

- Path-based permission mappings (`_all_paths`)
- Propagation schemas for hierarchical access control
- Context-aware role assignments

#### Permission Checkers
```python
class PathPermission(PermissionChecker):
    async def __call__(self, group_ids: Set[int], role_ids: Set[int], object: DeclarativeBase) -> bool:
        # Implementation details...
```

Permission checkers implement specific logic for validating access rights. The `PathPermission` checks whether a user has the necessary permissions to interact with specific database objects based on their path traversal.

### 3. **Contextual Access Control**

SQLAlchemy JS introduces the concept of `Context` objects:

```python
class Context(NamedTuple):
    id: int
    table: str
```

Contexts allow fine-grained control over permissions at different levels of data hierarchy, supporting complex multi-tenant or multi-environment systems.

## Key Features

### 1. **Hierarchical Path-Based Permissions**

SQLAlchemy JS supports tree-based path traversal for object permissions:

```python
from jsalchemy_auth.traversers import treefy_paths, tree_traverse

# Define paths for different resource types
paths = treefy_paths("users", "organizations", "projects")
```

This enables flexible permission assignment across nested object hierarchies, such as:
- Users within organizations
- Projects under specific departments
- Documents nested within folders

### 2. **Flexible Permission Composition**

Using logical operators, complex permissions can be constructed:

```python
# Example: Require either "read" OR "write" permission
permission = PathPermission("read", "documents") | PathPermission("write", "documents")

# Example: Require both "admin" AND "delete" permissions
permission = PathPermission("admin", "system") & PathPermission("delete", "data")

# Example: Deny access if user has "blocked" role
permission = ~(PathPermission("access", "restricted_resource"))
```

### 3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

The framework integrates seamlessly with RBAC models:

```python
# Define roles and permissions
role_permission = Table(
    'roles_permissions',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('role_id', Integer, ForeignKey(f'{Role.__tablename__}.id')),
    Column('permission_id', Integer, ForeignKey(f'{Permission.__tablename__}.id'))
)
```

Roles can be assigned to user groups, and permissions can be granted to roles through association tables.

### 4. **Async Support**

Built with async/await support for modern Python applications:

```python
async def check_user_access(self, user_id: int, resource: DeclarativeBase) -> bool:
    group_ids = await self._get_user_groups(user_id)
    role_ids = await self._get_user_roles(user_id)
    
    # Check path permissions asynchronously
    return await PathPermission("read", "documents")(group_ids, role_ids, resource)
```

### 5. **Caching and Performance Optimization**

SQLAlchemy JS includes caching mechanisms to optimize repeated permission checks:

```python
from jsalchemy_web_context.cache import redis_cache, request_cache

# Cache role assignments and permission checks
# Reduce database load in high-traffic scenarios
```

## Real-Life Usage Examples

### Example 1: Multi-Tenant SaaS Application

In a SaaS platform where each tenant has isolated data:

```python
# Define permissions for multi-tenant access
tenant_read = PathPermission("read", "tenants", "data")
tenant_write = PathPermission("write", "tenants", "data")

# Complex permission requiring admin rights within tenant scope
tenant_admin = (
    PathPermission("admin", "tenants") &
    PathPermission("write", "tenants", "data")
)

# Usage in application logic
async def can_access_tenant_data(user_id: int, tenant_id: str) -> bool:
    auth = Auth(base_class=Base)
    
    # Get user's group and role IDs
    group_ids = await auth._get_user_groups(user_id)
    role_ids = await auth._get_user_roles(user_id)
    
    # Check access with path-based permissions
    return await tenant_read(group_ids, role_ids, tenant_data_object)
```

### Example 2: Content Management System (CMS)

For managing content with hierarchical structure:

```python
# Define CMS permissions
content_read = PathPermission("read", "content", "articles")
content_create = PathPermission("create", "content", "articles")
content_publish = PathPermission("publish", "content", "articles")

# Complex permission for content editors
editor_permissions = (
    (content_read | content_create) & 
    PathPermission("moderate", "content")
)

# Use in CMS workflow
async def can_edit_article(user_id: int, article_id: str) -> bool:
    auth = Auth(base_class=Base)
    
    # Check if user has appropriate permissions for article editing
    return await editor_permissions(
        await auth._get_user_groups(user_id),
        await auth._get_user_roles(user_id),
        article_object
    )
```

### Example 3: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)

For enterprise systems with complex organizational structures:

```python
# ERP permission model
erp_read = PathPermission("read", "erp", "finance")
erp_write = PathPermission("write", "erp", "finance")
department_manager = PathPermission("manage", "erp", "departments")

# Complex hierarchical permissions
finance_admin = (
    erp_read & 
    erp_write &
    PathPermission("approve", "erp", "transactions")
)

# Usage in financial workflows
async def can_approve_transaction(user_id: int, transaction: Transaction) -> bool:
    auth = Auth(base_class=Base)
    
    # Check if user can approve based on department hierarchy
    return await finance_admin(
        await auth._get_user_groups(user_id),
        await auth._get_user_roles(user_id),
        transaction
    )
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. **Propagation Schema**

Supports hierarchical permission propagation:

```python
propagation_schema = {
    "departments": ["organizations", "corporations"],
    "projects": ["departments", "organizations"]
}

# Allows permissions to flow from higher-level entities to lower ones
```

### 2. **Global Context Support**

Special handling for global permissions:

```python
GLOBAL_CONTEXT = Context(id=0, table='global_context')

# Global permissions apply to entire system or specific scopes
global_admin = GlobalPermission("admin", auth_instance)
```

### 3. **Customizable Action Mapping**

Flexible mapping of actions to permissions:

```python
actions = {
    "create": "create",
    "read": "read",
    "update": "write",
    "delete": "delete"
}
```

## Integration Points

### 1. **Database Models**

SQLAlchemy JS works with standard SQLAlchemy models:

```python
class UserMixin:
    """Mixin for user model."""
    
class UserGroupMixin:
    """Mixin for user group model."""
    
class RoleMixin:
    """Mixin for role model."""
    
class PermissionMixin:
    """Mixin for permission model."""
```

### 2. **Web Framework Integration**

Can be easily integrated with popular web frameworks like FastAPI, Flask, or Django:

```python
# Example FastAPI integration
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException

async def require_permission(permission: str):
    async def check_permissions(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
        auth = Auth(base_class=Base)
        # Implementation logic here
        return True
    return check_permissions
```

### 3. **Caching Layer**

Integrates with Redis and request-level caching:

```python
# Configure caching for performance optimization
from jsalchemy_web_context.cache import redis_cache, request_cache

# Cache frequently accessed role assignments and permission checks
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. **Database Optimization**

SQLAlchemy JS provides optimized queries through:

- Batch role retrieval
- Efficient path traversal algorithms
- Cached permission lookups

### 2. **Memory Management**

The framework manages memory efficiently by:

- Caching role assignments
- Reusing context objects
- Implementing lazy loading for complex permission structures

### 3. **Scalability Features**

Designed to scale with:
